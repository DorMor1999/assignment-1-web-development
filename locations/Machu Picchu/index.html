            Machu Picchu is an ancient Incan citadel located in the Andes Mountains of Peru. Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it remained hidden until its rediscovery in 1911 by Hiram Bingham. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is renowned for its remarkable architecture, sophisticated dry-stone walls, and stunning panoramic views. Machu Picchu is a symbol of Incan civilization and is one of the most visited tourist destinations in South America, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to marvel at its beauty and mystery.        </p>
